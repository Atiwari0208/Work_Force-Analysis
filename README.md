# üß© Advanced SQL Workforce Analysis

## üìù Short Description
A set of advanced SQL queries developed to explore, compare, and analyze workforce demographics, seniority, departmental distribution, and diversity across multiple dimensions. This project demonstrates the use of subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and complex joins to answer practical business questions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **SQL**: Data querying, aggregation, filtering, and analysis
- **RDBMS** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server): Execution environment for queries
- **Data Modeling**: Logical schema understanding and table relationships

## ‚ú® Features and Highlights

### üìå Business Problem
Organizations often lack clear insights into workforce demographics, seniority profiles, and diversity distributions. The challenge is to extract actionable information from relational databases to inform HR strategy and decision-making.

### üéØ Goal of the Analysis
This project aims to answer seven essential business questions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Which employees belong to the Asian ethnicity group?**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Which city has the highest number of employees above age 55?**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Which country employs the largest number of staff in a specific department?**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **How many IT employees are working in the IT department across different countries?**  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the country-wise distribution of employees across business units?**  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Who are the five most senior employees in the company?**  
7Ô∏è‚É£ **How does gender diversity compare across business units?**

### üñ•Ô∏è Walkthrough of Key Queries
- **Ethnicity Filtering**: Used `WHERE` clauses and subqueries to identify employees belonging to Asian ethnicity.
- **Age Aggregation**: Applied `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to rank cities by senior employee count.
- **Department and Country Analysis**: Combined `JOINs` and `COUNT` to pinpoint top countries for departmental employment.
- **IT Employee Comparison**: Leveraged CTEs to compare IT headcounts by country.
- **Business Unit Distribution**: Created grouped summaries of workforce allocation.
- **Seniority Ranking**: Ordered employees by joining date to find the most senior staff.
- **Gender Diversity Analysis**: Produced comparative counts of gender representation across business units.

### üí° Business Impact & Insights
- **Diversity & Inclusion**: Clear visibility into ethnicity and gender composition.
- **Workforce Planning**: Identification of cities and countries with the most experienced employees.
- **Departmental Allocation**: Understanding where departments are concentrated geographically.
- **Talent Retention**: Highlighting senior employees who may require succession planning.
- **Strategic HR Decisions**: Data-driven insights for balancing workforce diversity and optimizing departmental distributions.
